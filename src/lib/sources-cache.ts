// Implements REQ-PIPE-001
//
// Centralized writer for `sources:{tag}` KV entries (CF-001 / AD16).
// Every writer in the system MUST go through this module. The
// invariant the coordinator's eviction recheck relies on — that the
// serialized form of a cache value is byte-equal whenever the logical
// content is identical — is enforced here by:
//
//   1. A single, explicit field order in `serialize()`. The two
//      writer call sites previously called `JSON.stringify({ feeds,
//      discovered_at })` inline; a future caller using a different
//      destructure order would silently break the byte-equal compare
//      that the coordinator's read-modify-write race recheck depends
//      on. Centralizing fixes this by construction.
//
//   2. A `discovered_at` field on every cache entry. The coordinator
//      now performs a STRUCTURAL recheck against this monotonic
//      timestamp instead of a raw byte compare — belt-and-suspenders.
//      Even if two writers diverge on serialization order, the race
//      detection still catches the collision.
//
// Same anti-pattern AD7 migrated AWAY from for chunk completion. See
// AD16 for the full reasoning + alternatives considered.
